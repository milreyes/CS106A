I guess these are not the best conditions to get to know each other. But Hi!
Hello Executioner Elena. I've heard you are compassionate and have a rich vocabulary.
Whats up?!?! Fast and painless or just save me without threatening my mental health.
How does it feel to have a life depend on your choice of letters?
I'm not nervous, I trust you! You got this girl? Hopefully?
Internal organs. Yeah. I guess I need those.
Go! Go! Go! E-L-E-N-A , try those! 
Now I can give you a High Five if you save me!
I don't have to pay for your ignorance!
Oh Stickgod! Enlighten her!
OK, now I don't trust you! You'd better get me out of this.
Did you try all the vowels?!?! Try  'Y' ! I might die of a heart attack before you hang me!
This is so LAST millennium. Why don't you get an eraser and it is waaayy easier! No pain for me, and no embarrassment for you for not knowing your vocabulary.
I have a big stickfamily to feed! Don't do this to me! 
How in stickheaven I got in this tragedy?!?!
This is my Will: all of my resources go to the National Fund for the Spelling Bees Contests.
The stickgenerations to come will avenge all of our stickpeople who have died to entertain you guys! You are selfish!
